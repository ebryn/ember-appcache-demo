In this talk, I'll go over how to use Ember to build, organize, and deploy HTML5-<code>canvas</code> based games.</p><p>Using Ember to develop games shares the same benefits of using Ember to develop applications—both the toolchain and the conventions alleviate decision fatigue. For example, route-driven paths are great at handling levels, Liquid Fire provides lovely transitions for menus, and adapters provide a standard way to connect to backends for saving high scores.</p>\n            "},{"day":"Day 2: March 30","title":"Compose Yourself with Ember and D3","speakers":["Ivan Vanderbyl"],"imageUrl":"images/bio-ivan-vanderbyl.jpg","time":"10:45–11:15am","description":"\n              <p>Say you're building a chart, what's the most natural representation for specifying a visualization?
